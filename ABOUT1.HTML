      <h1>About Starry K-Shop</h1>
      <p>More than a store‚ÄîStarry K-Shop is your gateway to the heart of K-Pop culture.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-box">
      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        Starry K-Shop was established in 2023 with a simple yet passionate goal‚Äîto bring K-Pop closer to fans worldwide. 
        What started as a small store dedicated to a few artists quickly grew into a one-stop shop for everything K-Pop. 
        From albums and posters to light sticks and limited-edition merchandise, we‚Äôve been committed to providing fans with 
        authentic and high-quality products.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the K-Pop wave (Hallyu) expanded globally, so did our store. We embraced e-commerce to reach international fans 
        who wanted easy access to official merchandise. Today, we take pride in being a trusted and beloved K-Pop shop, 
        serving fans from all corners of the world.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission: Bringing K-Pop to You</h2>
      <p>
        At Starry K-Shop, our mission is simple: to connect K-Pop fans with the artists they love by offering a wide range 
        of official merchandise. We understand the excitement of unboxing a new album, the joy of waving a light stick at a 
        concert, and the pride of collecting rare photocard sets. Our goal is to make these experiences accessible to everyone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-box">
      <h2>Our Vision: A Global K-Pop Community</h2>
      <p>
        We envision a future where K-Pop fans, regardless of location, can easily access their favorite merch and be part of 
        a vibrant community. Our store aims to be more than just a shop‚Äîit‚Äôs a place where fans can connect, share their 
        passion, and celebrate the artists they admire.

      <h2>Product Highlight: Official Light Sticks</h2>
      <p>
        One of our best-selling products is the official K-Pop light stick. These iconic items are a staple at concerts, 
        creating breathtaking waves of synchronized color. Each light stick features a unique design for its group, 
        and some even have Bluetooth syncing for immersive experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Starry K-Shop, we guarantee that all our light sticks are 100% authentic and sourced directly from entertainment 
        companies. We want every fan to feel the magic of holding their official light stick during a performance.
